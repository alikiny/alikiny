## You reading is highly apprecited :v:
*I do not love coding, I live it!*
It does not matter which language we use, it is all about usability and readability. No one should be left behinds tech and innovation. I fight for the harmony of coding and app's usage. Simplicity and Functionality are my priority at coding. I am ready for all criticism and constructive feedbacks, so be free to give me your words!
