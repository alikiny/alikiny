<h1>Hi there! May I'm the final piece in your puzzle </h1>

## You reading is highly appreciated :v:
*I do not love coding, I live it!*
It does not matter which languages we use, it is all about usability and readability. No one should be left behind tech and innovation. I fight for the harmony of coding and app's usage. Simplicity and Functionality are my priority at coding. I am ready for all criticism and constructive feedbacks, so be free to give me your words!
